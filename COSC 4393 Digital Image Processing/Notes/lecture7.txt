Digital Image Processing Lecture 7

X is rows
Y is columns

Binary images and bimodal histograms contd.

Logical operations (again)
    NOT
    AND 
    OR
    
    Demorgan's laws 

    MAJ - majority operator
        Number of input variables must be odd
    
Logical operators on images

    Binary AND
        Shows the overlap of black regions
    
    Binary OR
        Shows the overlap of white regions
    
    XOR on 2 images gives the difference in white and black pixels


Blob coloring
    Region classification and correction

    Usually used to extract a small number of objects or single object by thresholding

    Classify pixels based on their neighborhood
        if the pixels in its neighborhood are 1 then the pixel is a 1
    
    if pixel == 1
        if P(x-1,y) == 0 and P(x,y-1) == 0
            Image_regions(x,y) = region
            region += 1
        if P(x-1,y) == 0 and P(x, y-1) == 1
            Image_region(x,y) = Image_region(x,y-1)
        if P(x-1,y) == 1 and P(x, y-1) == 0
            Image_region = image_region(x-1,y)
        if P(x-1,y) == 1 and P(x,y-1) == 1
            if image_region(x,y-1) == image_region(x-1, y)
                image_region(x,y) = image_region(x,y-1)
            else
                iterate through all pixels and replace region with same region


    After blob coloring you can simply retain the blob with the greatest number of pixels

    To remove holes, complement the image and do the blob correction again which removes all the small white blobs
