Digital Image Processing Lecture 3

Intro to Python

	Python is interpreted not compiled
	
Printing 
	Elements separated by a comma print with a space in between
	print("Hllo","world)
		Hello world
		

Variables are just assigned not declared
	Don't need a type 
	Variables are simply references to objects
	
Everything in python is an object


Complex numbers are built in to python
	x = 3+2j
	y = -1j
	x + y
	>>(3+1j)

Numbers are immutable

String functions

len(String) - length of a string

str(Object) - Converts object into a string


String formatting
	<formatted strin> % <element to insert>
	Can use %s for everything
	
Datastructures

1. List - Data can be of different types (mutable_
	x = ["hello", (3+2j), 3]
	x[0]
	x[0:2] - Not including 2
	x.append("dssd") - Adds new elemnt to the end of the list
	x[i] = a
	
2. Tuples - Similar to lists but immutable
	x = (1,2,3)
	x[1:]
	Declaring a tuple with one value must end with comma y = (2,)
	

3. Dictionaries (Mutable) (unordered)
	Sets of key value pairs
	d = {1:"hello", 2:"two", "three":42}
	can use any data type for keys and pairs
	keys must be immutable so no lists
	del(x[1]) deletes objects from a dictionary
	

Copying data structures

newlist = list(x)
newdictionary = copy(dictionary)


Boolean
	0 and none are considered false
	Everything else is considered true
	
	Empty list is considered false
	

Control statements

break - Jumps 

continue - Skips 

pass - nothing empty placeholder

The Loop else clause
	Can use an else after a loop
	executes if the loop exits normally not by a break
	
range(int)
	Generates an array of numbers 
	Used for iterating through loops
	for x in range(5):
		

Functions
	def name():
	
	functions are first class objects
		can be assigned to a variable
		can be passed as a parameter
		can be returned from a functions

	Can also define functions inside of other functions
	

Parameters: names
	call by name
	any positional arguments must come before named ones in a call
	
	def foo(a,b,c):
	
Parameters: Default
	def foo(x=3):
		print(x)
	
	foo()
		>>3
	foo(10)
		>>10
	

Modules
	Highest level structures in python
	
	import mymodule - brings all elements of mymodule in but must refer to it as mymodule.<element>
	
	from mymodule import x
	
	from mymodule import *
	
from math import *

In assignments do not use built in functions from numpy or opencv


Logical operators
	and
	or
	not
	
Tools and software

	numpy - numerical computing (matrices)
	Matplotlib - basic graphing + plotting
	OpenCV - open source computer vision library


Typically images are 8-bit black and white 
	pixel values range from 0 (dark) to 255 (light)
	
	Color images are basically 3 of the matrices one each for red, green, and blue
	
	
Numpy operations are element wise

dot product
	np.dot(A,B)
	
Transpose
	matrix.T
	

OpenCV Examples

	1. Load and Display images
		1. Shape images
		2. Converting to grey scale/ color spaces
		
	2. Create images
	
	3. Access pixels
	
	4. Writing/Drawing on images
