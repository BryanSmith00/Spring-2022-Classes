## Edge Detection contd'
---
<br>

Edges take the form of discontinuties in an image

Derivative theorem of convolution ...

First order derivative - Look for max and min values<br>
Second order derivative - Look for x-intercepts (zero crossings)<br>

Step 1: Smooth image<br>
Step 2: Take the derivative of the image in the x direction and y direction and find the magnitude of combining the 2<br>
Step 3: Find the edges by thresholding for maximum and minimum values<br></br>

When filtering using a Gaussian and then taking the derivative you can combine the two by taking the derivative of the gaussian filter then convolving it with the image<br></br>

### [Prewitt filter]()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[-1 0 1]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[-1 0 1]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[-1 0 1]<br>

Applies the smoothing and finds the gradient along the x direction<br></br>

### [Sobel edge detector](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/sobel.htm)

Convolution with another filter<br></br>

Prewitt and Sobel

Quick and simple but sensitive to noise and leads to multiple responses, also need to fine tune thresholding<br></br>


### [Marr Hildreth Edge Detector]()
1. Smooth image with gaussian filter
2. Apply second order derivative (laplacian)
3. Find zero crossings
4. Find slope of zero crossings
5. Threshold slopes to find edges

You can combine the first 2 steps by taking the laplacian of the gaussian filter and convolving it directly with the image (formula in slides)

The combined formula allows you to generate a filter to convolve with the image<br></br>


### Finding Zero Crossings

Four cases: neg->pos, neg->0->pos, pos->neg, pos->0->neg<br>

Compute the slope of the zero crossings along x and y and threshold them to avoid false positives<br></br>


### [Canny Edge Detector](https://justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/)
1. Smooth image with gaussian filter
2. Compute derivative of filtered image (x and y)
3. Find magnitude and orientation of gradient (perpendicular to x and y derivative on the edge)
4. Apply "non-maximum suppression"
5. Apply "hysteresis threshold"

Non-Maximum suppression looks at all the pixels along the gradient orientation (perpendicular combination of the x and y gradient directions) and removes the non maximum pixels

This allows the image to have more single response edges

Hysteresis threshold - Etablish a high and low thresholds, above high are marked as edges, below low is discarded, and pixels inbetween you check their neighbors to see if they are edges, if an inbetween pixel has edge neighbors save it as an edge too.
