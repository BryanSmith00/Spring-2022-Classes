# Digital Image Processing Lecture 24?
Week ?? Thursday

### Useful latex commands
Fourier transform is linear<br>
convolution $\bigoplus$<br>
$\sigma_{local}$ - Sigma local<br>
$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i$<br>
$\eta(x,y)$<br></br>

## Restoration filters
---

With statistical noise it is impossible to find the exact noise function to subtract out, g(x,y) = f(x,y) + $\eta(x,y)$

* Mean filters
* Order-statistic filters
* Adaptive filters<br></br>

### Mean Filters

* Arithmetic mean filter<br>
bad

* Geometric mean filter<br>
Smooths the image but removes fewer details than arithmetic<br>
Not good for impulse noise

* Contraharmonic mean filter<br>
Removes either salt or pepper noise not both, Q>0 for pepper noise. Q<0 for salt noise<br>
When Q=-1 special case, Harmonic filter<br>
Decreases or increases the size of black regions<br></br>

### Order-Statistic Filters
Based on ranking the pixel values 

* Min filter<br>
Good for salt noise

* Median filter<br>
Good for statistical noise and bipolar noise

* Max filter<br>
Good for pepper noise

* Midpoint filter<br>

* Alpha-trimmed mean filter<br>
Remove a certain number of pixels at each end<br></br>

### Adaptive filters
Uses a statistical approach to decide if you should apply the filter or not

* Local noise reduction filter<br>
Uses Mean and variance of local and global noise<br></br>

### Frequency domain filtering
Band reject filters

You can isolate the noise by computing the Fourier transform of the image and designing a notch, band, etc filter. Then compute the inverse Fourier transform, multiply the noise image by a weight matrix and subtract it from the image.

Use a weight matrix to specify what portions of the image are more important and thus don't remove as much noise or image content from them.
