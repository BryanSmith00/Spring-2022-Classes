Digital Image Processing Lecture 5

Spacial Resolution 
    The smallest discenrible detail in an image

Geometric Transformation
    Make an image larger or smaller

    Multiply all pixel locations by the scaling factor


Interpolation
    The process of using known data to estimate unknown values
        eg zooming, shrinking, resampling, etc

    
Inverse Lookup
    1. Create an image of the desired size
    2. For each pixel in the new image caculate which pixel it corresponds to in the original image
    3. Uses values from nearby pixel to guess missing values

Nearest Neighbor Interpolation
    For the reverse lookup just choose the closest pixel and use that values

Linear Interpolation (1D)


Bilinear Interpolation (2D)
    Uses 4 nearest neighbors
    3 iterations of linear Interpolation

Bicubic Interpolation
    16 neighbors
