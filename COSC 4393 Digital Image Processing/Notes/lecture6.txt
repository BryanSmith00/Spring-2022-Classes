Digital Image Processing Lecture 6

Binary Image
    Matrix of 0s and 1s
    Black and white image

    1 or 0 usually indicates the presence of an image property

    Convention we will use
        1 = Black
        0 = white

    Advantages
        Very little storage required (24x less data than color)
        Simple abstraction of information
        Fast processing, ability to use logical operators
        Can be compressed further

    Simple thresholding
        Simplest form of image processing
        Define an integer threshold if the value of each pixel is greater assign it one value and another if false

        Pick a threshold based on the two most common modes of the pixels of the image
            ie. most of the pixels are 10 or 0 with some outliers so take 10 and 0 as the modes and average them for threshold
        

        Histograms
            Can use a histogram to find the modes 
            Generally works best BIMODAL images. eg dark background and light foreground or vice versa
                or an image with clear peaks in the histogram
            
            Expected value (Method for finding threshold)
                Sum(X p(x))
                Sum up the values multiplied by their probabilities

                Algorithm
                    Assume a threshold (start in the middle)
                    Compute the expected value on each side of the threshold and calculate the mean
                    Take the mean of the expected values as new threshold
                    Recompute the expected values until they no longer change

            Otsu's binarization (Method for finding threshold)
                Calculate mean and variance for each possible threshold
                Weighted sum of the variances
                    Weight is the sum of all the probabilities on that side
                
                Algorithm
                    Compute histogram
                    Computeprobabilites for each value
                    Iterate through all possible threshold values
                        Calculate the weight of each side
                        Calculate the mean of each side
                        Calculate the variance of each side
                        Calculate the weighted sum of the variances
                    Pick the threshold that minimizes the weighted sum of variances
