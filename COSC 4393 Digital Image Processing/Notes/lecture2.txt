Digital Image Processing Lecture 2


Pinhole camera/Camera Obscura
	Add a barrier to block off most of the rays 
	this reduces blurring 
	the opening is known as an aperture
	Image is inverted
	
	The smaller the aperture the less blurry the image is
		up to a certain point then making it smaller makes it blurry again
		
Lens either in front of behind the aperture
	Lens focuses parallet ray into a single focal point
	focal point is at distance f
	
	focal length depends on radius of the lens and refractory index
		more curved the further the focal distance is
	
	1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)
	
	Lens focuses the light onto the sensor
		there is a specific distance at which objects are in focus
		distance between lens and sensor
		
Optics of the eye

	Iris - aperture, muscle that controls how much light is let in
	lens - lens
	Cornea - clear front surface of the eye, main refractive surface of they eye
		also acts as filter for only visible light
	
	Retena
		Surface on the back of the eye where the light is focused
		Contains nerves called photoreceptors that react to light
		Photoreceptors come in 2 shapes
			Rods - Low light confitions, scotopic vision
			Cones - high light conditions, photopic vision
			
			Cones are mostly around the center of the eye and are smaller in number and larger in size
				higher resolution than rods
			Rods are most common at 20 degrees away from the center and there are many more of them. smaller in size
				This means that at night you cannot see something directly in front of the center of your eye at night
				
		Peripheral vision provides very little color information
			but is very good at detecting motion
			
		Eyes have 3 sets of sensors with peak sensetivities at light frequencies, red (580nm), green (540nm), and blue (450nm)
			Red cones, blue cones, green cones
		
		Rods are more sensitive to light and percieve more of the visible spectrum
		
Factors affecting visibility

	Contrast - Relationship between the luminance of an object and its background
		Background vs. foreground
	
	Size - size of the image on the retina, larger is easier to see
	
	Time - when viewed very briefly brain cannot process fast enough to see the details
	
	
Steps in the process of vision

	Physics of light
	imaging process (optics of the eye)
	Visual sensors (photoreceptors)
	Low-level image processing (retinal mechanisms)
	High-level image processing (central brain mechanisms, cerebral cortex)

	Low level processing - image formation, sampling, spacial filtering

	Higher levels are less well understood
