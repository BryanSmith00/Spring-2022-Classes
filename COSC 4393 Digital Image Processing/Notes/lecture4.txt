Digital Image Processing Lecture 4

Perspective projection - reduction of the dimensionality of a projection
	3D world to a 2D imaging plane
	
	Center of the lens represents (0,0,0) in the 3D plane. Z represents depth
	
	(x,y) are the dimensions of the imaging plane
	
	f/C - Magnification factor
		f = focal length
		C = distance from lens to object
	
	Similar triangles
	
	
How do we generate a digital image

	Start with a picture of something
	
	Lay a grid over the picture and measure the intensity/brightness of each cell
	
	f(x,y) intensity on the imaging surface = i(x,y) illumination from light source * r(x,y) reflectivity index
	
	Light is typically measured in Lumens (Luminous flux)
		90,000 lumens/m^2 on a sunny day
		
	Grey scale - scale of luminousity from black to white
	

Sensors can come in different form factors

	Single sensor can be translated around to capture an image (scanner)
	
	Strip sensor - Line of sensors so image is fixed along the length of the strip (Imaging from flights)
	
	Array sensor - 2D grid of sensors to capture a 2D image of fixed x and y dimensions
	
	
Analog/Digital Conversion

	Sampling and quantization
	
	Quantizing - Binning the samples so you don't end up with very similar samples right near each other
	
	Sampling
		Converts the analog signal to a digital representation by taking a sample every certain distance
		
	Quantization
		Each pixel grey level is quantized assigned one of the finite set of numbers (generally integers indexed from 0 - k-1)
		Typically there are K = 2^b grey values
		b is the number of bits representing the grey values
		

Representing Digital Images

	Discrete intensity interval [0, L-1] L=2^k 
		AKA dynamic range
		
	Total bits is m*n*b which is width by length by number of bits for each pixel
	

Spacial Resolution
	A measure of the smalles discernible detail in an image
	Stated with line pairs per unit distance (pixels per inch) or dots per inch dpi
	

Intensity Resolution
	The smallest discernible change in intensity levl
	stated with 8 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, etc
