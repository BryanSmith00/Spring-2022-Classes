Digital Image Processing Lecture 9

Binary Image Processing contd.

Combination morphological operators

    OPEN = erosion (by b) followed by a dilation (by b)
        where b is the window

    Only the small objects are removed the small holes remain

    CLOSE = Dilation -> Erosion

    OPEN-CLOSE || CLOSE-OPEN
        tend to link neighboring objects together

    
Skeletonization
    A way of obtaining an image's medial axis or skeleton

    Algorithm on the powerpoint

    Basically use a series of OPEN operations


Compression: Run Length Coding
    The number of bits required to store an N x N binary image is N^2

    Works well with large black or white regions

    Instead of sending each pixel it groups them by runs
        ie. 5 black pixels in a row, you can just send 5 instead of 5 ones

    Worst case: checkerboard pattern

        If average run length is less than number of bits for each number being sent it is not efficien


Compression: Contour representation and chain Coding

    Used on contour images instead of binary

    Contour - each black pixel can have at most 2 black pixels in its 8-neighborhood
        single pixel thick lines

    Chain code
        Observe that if the initial coordinate of an 8-connected controu is known then the rest 
            of the contour can be coded by giving directions from the previous pixel
        


Point operations

    Average Optical Density
        Average intensity of an image

        low or high AOD can tell if the image is under or overexposed

    A point operation is a function f that maps image I to another image J by operating on each pixel
        The same function is applied at every point
    
    Linear Point Operations 
        Do not modify spacial relationships between points

        Y = P * Intensity + B
            P - Scaling factor
                Stretches or compresses the histogram

            B - Offset
                Shifts the histogram


    Full-Scale Contrast Stretch 
        y = P * X + L

    
    Nonlinear Point Operations
