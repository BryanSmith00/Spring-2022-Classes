You don't need a camera to capture an image you just need an appropriate imaging device
	-ex. viewing a solar eclipse can be done by poking holes in a box
	

Electro Magnetic waves 
to capture digital images you simply need an em wave and a sensor that captures that wave


Emitted radiation - Object directly emits the EM radiation that you capture. ex. imaging the sun
Reflected radiation - Radiation comes from a source, bounces off of an object and is observed. ex. looking at the moon
Altered radiation - Source of light with an object in front of it that you capture. ex. x rays


Gamma-ray imaging
	Nuclear medicine uses gamma rays to capture images
	PET scan
