## Image Restoration
---
Similar to image enhancement, goal is to improve the image<br>

Restoration is an objective process to remove degradation<br>

Degradation model can be represented as the original image convolved with a degradation function plus an additive noise function

* we focus mainly on noise not so much the convolving<br></br>

## Noise
---
Noise comes from image aquisition and/or transmission

Types of noise
* Spatially independent noise - random noise; noise is a function not dependent on the image
* Spatially dependent noise - noise (x,y) depends on the image (x,y); the noise is a function of the image<br></br>

### independent noise
---
Statistical noise
* Defined by a function H(x,y), usually a probability distribution)

Gaussian noise
* electronic circuit noise
* sensor noise due to poor illumination or high temperatures
* Bell curve distribution

Rayleigh Noise
* Ranged imaging noise (radar, etc)

Gamma noise

Exponential noise
* Created by laser imaging

Impulse noise (salt and pepper noise)
* faulty switching results in quick transients

Uniform noise
* not common in practice
* good to understand tho<br></br>


### Dependent noise
---
Periodic noise
* Electrical or electromechanical interference<br></br>


## Estimation of noise
---
To estimate the noise from an image take a solid background color area of the image and plot the distribution of the noise in that region
