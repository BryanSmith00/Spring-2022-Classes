Database Design Lecture 3

Snapshot - backup of the database. copy

database is self describing
	Catalog - metadata
		Gives you the description of the types of data stored
		
Characteristixs of a database approach
	Insulation between programs and data
		Program-data independence
		Allows changing data structures and storage organization in the programs without impacting the DBMS
		
	Data abstraction
		Data model - used to hide storage details and present the users with a conceptual view of the database
		
	Support multiple views of the data
		Different people can see different pieces of the data
		
	Sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing
		Concurrency control
	
		Recovery subsystem ensures each completed transaction is permanently recorded in the database
	
	Controlling redundancy in data storage
	
	Enable sharing od data among multiple users
	
	Provide storage structures eg indexers for efficient query processing'
	
	Persistent storage for program objects
	
	Representing complex relationships among data
	
	Active processing and triggers*
	

Database Users

	Actors on the scene - Those who use control design develop and maintain the database
		Database admins
			Responsible for authorizing access to the database
			For coordinating and monitoring database use
	
		Database designers
			Responsible forr defining the contents, structure, constraints, and functions of the database
			Communicate with the end user and find out their needs
			
		End Users
			Enter data, run queries, update the database content
			
	Workers behind the scene  - those who design and develop dbms software and related tools
