Database Lecture 8

Mini world

    The Scope of your project. Not the entire universe but only the part you are supporting
    our mini world would be how the users can interact with the database and have access to music


Weak entity
    An entity that does not have a key attribute
    Identification dependent on another identity

    A weak entity must participate in an identifying relationship type with an owner or identifying entity type


ER Model

    Entities
    Attributes
    Relationships


Relationships and relationship types
    A relationship relates two or more distince entities with a specific meaning

    ex. an employee works on a project. An employee manages a department

    Relationship types
        Binary relationship - degree 2 relationship    
        N to 1 (N:1) - many to one. eg. many employees work in 1 department
        M:N - many to many

    Degree of a relationship type - the number of participating entity types

    Relationship type
        is the schema description of a relationship
        identifies the relationship name and the participating entity types
        also identifies certain relationship constraints

    Relationship set
        The current set of relationship instances represented in the database
        the current state of a relationship type

    Relationships can have attributes

    More than 1 relationship type can exist between the same participating entity types

    Relationship constraints
        Cardinality ratio 
            1:1
            1:N
            M:N
        
        Existence dependency constraint specifies minimum participation
            zero 
            one or more

    Ternary relationship

    Recursive relationship type
        self-referenceing
            eg. 1 employee can be a supervisor and 1 can be a supervisee
