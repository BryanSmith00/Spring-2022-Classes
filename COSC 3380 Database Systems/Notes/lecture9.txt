Enumerated variables

Relational Data Model

    A relation looks like a table of values
    a relation typically contains a set of rows

    columns are the attributes


    key of a relation
        each row has a value of a data item that uniquely identifies that row in the table

        sometimes row ids or sequential/random numbers are assigned as keys to identify rows
            Call ARTIFICIAL KEYS or SURROGATE KEYS

        
    Schema of a relation
        denoted by R(a1,a2,,...an)
        R is the name of the relation
        the attributes of the relation are a1,a2,...an 

        Degree or arity of a relation
            number of attributes n of its relation schema

        ex. relation, STUDENT(Name:string, SSN:string, Address:string, Home_phone:string, Office_Phone:string)

        Attribute Domains
            Set of atomic values
            each value is indivisible
            data types

        ex. domain, USA_Phone_Number. the set of 10 digit numbers valid in the united states 
                    GPA. possible values must be floating point numbers between 0 and 4

        Attribute cardinality
            total number of values in a domain 

        Current relation state
            relation state at a given time 

            changes in relation states dont change the schema

    Attribute names
        meaningful names
