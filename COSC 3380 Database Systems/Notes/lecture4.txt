Databases Lecture 4

End Users
	
	Sophisticaed
		These incluse busines analysts, scientists, engineers, and others who are familiar with the system's capabilities
		Many use tools in the form of software packages that work closely with the stored database
		
	Stand-alone
		Mostly maintain personal databases using ready to use packaged applications
		
	System analysists and application developers
		Understand user requirements of naive and sophisticated users
		Design applications including canned transactions to meet those requirements
		
	Application Programmer
		Implement the specifications developed by analysts
		Test and debug
		
	Business analysts
		Analzye vast amounts of business data and real time data for better decision making
		

Actors behind the scene

	Tool developers
		Design and implement software systems
		modeling and designing databases
		prototypeing
		test data generation
		user interface creation
		simulation
		performance monitoring
		
	System designers and implementors
		Design and implement DBMS packages
	
	Operators and maintenance personnel
		Deal with the actual hardware
		

When not to use a dbms
	Id the database and applications are simple, well designed and not expected to change
	if access to the data by multiple users is not required
	
	In embedded systems
	
	In real time systems ie telephone switching
	
	if the data is too complex to handle with a dbms. Protein folding

Data Models

	A set of concepts to describe
		The STRUCTURE of the database
		The OPERATIONS for manipulating these structures
		Certain CONSTRAINTS that the database should obey
		
	Data model structure and constructs
		
		Define the database structure
		
		Constructs typically include ELEMENTS (and their data type) as well as groups of elements 
			(ENTITY, RECORD, TABLE, and RELATIONSHIPS among such groups)
		
		Constraints specify restrictions on valid data
			must be enforced at all times for all the data
			
	
	Data model operations
		insert, delete, update
		*CRUD - Create, read, update, delete
		
	User defined operations
		

Categories of data models

	Conceptual (High-level, semantic) data models
		provide concepts that are close to the way many users percieve the data
	
	Physical (Low-level, internal) data models
		provides concepts that describe how the data is stored in the computer
		usually managed completely by dbms and operating system
		
	Implementation (representational) data models
		provide concepts between conceptual and physical
		often used
		
	Self-describing data models
		combine the description of data with the data values
		

Schemas

	Description of the database
		includes descriptions of the database structure, data types, and constraints
		
	Schema Diagram
		An illustrative display of the schema
		

Instances

	Database state
		The actual data stored in the database in a moment in time
		Includes all the data in the database
		
		Content of the database at any point in time
		
		Initial database state
			database state when it is initially created and loaded into the system
			
		valid state
			a state that satisfies the structure and constraints of the database
		

******
DATABASE SCHEMA changes very infrequently

DATABASE STATE changes every time the database is update

SCHEMA -> INTENSION
STATE -> EXTENSION
