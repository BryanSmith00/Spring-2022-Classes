ER Model Concepts

    Entities and Attributes
        Entity is the basic concepts for the ER Model

        Entities are specific things or objects in the mini-world that are represented in the Database
            eg. Employee john smith, the research department, the product x

        Attributes are properties used to describe an Entity

    A specific entity will have a value for each of its Attributes

    Each attribute has a value set or data type associated with it - integer, string/char, date, enumerated type, etc


    Types of attributes
        Simple
            each entity has a single atomic value for the attribute, eg. SSN, gender

        Composite
            The attribute may be composed of several components, eg. Address, apt#, house#, street, city, zip, etc.
                name, first, middle, last

        Multi-valued
            An entitiy may have multiple values for that attribute, eg. color of a car, or how many degrees a student has


        Composite and multi-valued attributes may be nested arbitrarily to any number of levels


    Entity types and key attributes

        entities with the same basic attributes are grouped or typed into an entity type
            for example type employee and project 
        
        an attribute of an entity type for which each entity must have a unique value is called a key attribute
            key attributes can be composite

            an entity may have more than one key

        keys are underlined


    Value sets (Domains) of attributes

        Each simple attribute is associated with a value set
            eg. lastname has a value which is a character string of up to 30 characters
            date has a value consisting MM-DD-YYYY where each letter is an integer

        Value set specifies the set of values associated with an attribute


ER diagrams

    Entity types are displayed in a rectangular box

    Attributes are displayed in ovals
        key attributes are underlined
    

Steps for designing databases

    Aquire domain knowledge

    Gather requirements

            Types of attributes
                Simple, composite, multi-valued
