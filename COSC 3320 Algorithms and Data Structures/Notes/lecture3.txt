Counting operations
	1. mathematical operations, adding, subracting, multiplying
	2. accessing memory. Read, write
	
	Usually abstract out many of the operations and focus on the most costly operations
	

Asymptotic complexity notation
	asymptotic as n->infinity
	
	ignore constant factors
	
Big-O
	lim n->infinity f(n)/g(n) <= constant C
	

Efficient algorithms
	We generally consider polynomial functions to be efficient
	O(n), O(n^2).. etc
	
Exponential time = bad
