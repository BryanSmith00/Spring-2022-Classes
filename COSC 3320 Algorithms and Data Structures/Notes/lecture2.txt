Tiling problem contd.

Recursively break the problem down into smaller versions 
	Each subproblem must be an identical problem just smaller in size
	Once you get to a sufficiently small size you can brute force it
	
Mathematical induction

Base step
	n=1

Inductive step
	Assume inductive hypothesis
	
	Inductive hypothesis: Assume the strategy is correct for n<=k
	
	Prove the strategy is correct for n=k+1
	Prove the strategy is correct for 


Efficiency - reduce costly operations; complexity

Recurrence equation
	Solve by unwinding 
	Solve by induction
	Guess and verify - verify using induction
