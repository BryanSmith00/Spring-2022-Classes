## Dynamic Programming
---
As with divide and conquer it relies on breaking the problem down into subproblems and combining them back into a solution<br>

Decomposed subproblems are independent and overlapping
* Independent: The solution to one subproblem does not affect any other
* Overlapping: Solution of one subproblem might contain solutions to other subproblems<br>

Philosophy: Don't solve a subproblem more than once<br>

Dynamic programming is used in opimization problems: trying to find the maximum or minimum value for some domain<br>
* Feasible solutions is the set of all solutions that satisfy the constraints<br>
