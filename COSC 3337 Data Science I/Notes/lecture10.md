<br></br>
Logistic Regression - Used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables
<br></br>

## Logistic Regression
---
Binary variables; 1 or 0 linear regression breaks down <br></br>
Used to fit a curve to data in which the dependent variable is binary <br>
Typical application: Medicine
<br></br>
Generally results in a sigmoid function when the variable is binary
<br></br>
odds = p / (1â€“p)

logit(p) = ln(odds) = ln (p/(1-p)) <br>
logit(p) = b<sub>0</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>X
