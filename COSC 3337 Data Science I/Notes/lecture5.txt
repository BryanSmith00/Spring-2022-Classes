Linear Regression
    First order linear model
        y = b0 + b1*x + e
        b0 is the y intercept
        e is the error
    
    Least Squares Method

    Coefficient of Determination (R^2)
        Measure of the error of a linear regression model

    SSR - Variation explained by the regression line
    SSE - Unexplained variation (error) (Sum of squares for errors)

    R^2 is always between 0 and 1. 0 means that no variance has been explained, 1 is the opposite

    No linear relationship - line should be horizontal

    t stat? (large is good)
    p-value? (small is good)

    Do not rely on R^2 alone also take into account t stat and p-value


Interaction
    Write out the interaction that the model shows in english

OLS ordinary least squares

sklearn .score() gives R^2
