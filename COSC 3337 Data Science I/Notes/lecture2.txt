Data Science Lecture 2

Training the model - Find the coefficients
	Fitting the model - same thing

70-80% of data for training
20-30% testing

Predictive (Supervised learning)
	The science of using data to predict an outcome (clicking, price of stock)
	Uses a label of what to compare to
	
Descriptive (Unsupervised learning)
	Using data to group items/users into categories (ie. extract topics/categories from articles)
	No label to compare to

Prescriptive (Reinforcement learning)
	Optimizing action based on response variable 
	
Exploratory
	Can we describe characteristics of items/users with particular attributes we are interested interested
	
A/B testing


Linear Regression

	Given a colletion of points (x,y) to learn from can we find a function minimizing the distance to the data

	Testing - see how the model behaves with new data
	
Supervised 
	Regression
	Classification
	Recommendation engin
	decision tree
	
Model Quality

	Completeness
	
	Fidelity - do the measurements capture the reality. any issues or variance
	
	Consistency
	
	
Hadoop - Distributed framework for big data
